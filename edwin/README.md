# Edwin

Edwin is an Emacs-like editor with Evil keys and Org, scripted in its own Scheme. It runs in a web page. It is
becoming **edwind**, Workbench's text daemon: one Node service that owns every text buffer on the host. Workbench
page cards then attach to it as Edwin frames, as `emacsclient` frames attach to `emacs --daemon`.

The design and the decisions are in the doc "Edwin as Workbench's text daemon" (decided 2026-10-12): edwind
replaces the notes index and `sample` of M5 (M5-W1, M5-W2), pages are files in `notesDir`, markdown-mode comes
first, undo undoes your own edits, and the runtime is Node.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/*.js` | the editor, in the order `index.html` loads it: `scheme` `runtime` `text` `editor-core` `editor-prims` `evil-core` `pool` `complete` `extras` `stack` `ai` `evil-ex` `org` |
| `scm/*.scm` | the shipped Scheme configuration (`emacs`, `evil`, `org`, `ai`, `init`), also inlined in `index.html` |
| `index.html` | the page: styles, the Scheme blocks and the script tags. It loads `src/*.js` relative to itself, so serving this directory runs it, and a published copy keeps the `src/` paths |
| `src/host-browser.js`, `src/host-node.js` | the host layer (R4.1): storage, the shipped Scheme, page attributes, suspend, clipboard, scheduling. The core reaches the page only through it and through frame objects |
| `test/headless.mjs` | loads and boots the editor in Node on `host-node.js` (no page objects exist in the process) and drives it with keys |
| `test/headless.test.mjs` | the headless suite: `node --test edwin/test/headless.test.mjs`, or `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.edwin-headless` |
| `test/scheme.test.mjs`, `test/scheme-editor.test.mjs` | the Scheme suite: the language, and the editor-level forms. `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.edwin-scheme` runs both and the benchmark |
| `test/scheme-bench.mjs` | evaluator benchmarks; fails when the shadow stack costs more than 10% (R4.34) |
| `src/ot.js` | the OT library (ops, transform, rebase, undo, markers, hash) shared by edwind and its clients (E1) |
| `server/*.mjs` | edwind, the text daemon (E1; see "Step E1" below) |
| `test/ot.test.mjs`, `test/ot-sim.mjs` | the OT properties with fast-check (`edwin-ot`; needs `NODE_PATH` at `tools/node_modules`) |
| `test/conformance.test.mjs`, `test/crash.test.mjs`, `test/disk.test.mjs`, `test/edit-client.mjs` | the edwind gate suites (`edit-conformance`, `edit-crash`, `edit-disk`) and their client |

These files came from the published Edwin artifact (version 1791768765, 2026-10-12). From now on this directory is
the source.

## Step E0: the core without a browser (done)

The E0 gate of the edwind spec (§17) passes: `edwin-scheme`, `edwin-headless` with no stubs, and the other checks.

- **Host layer and boot (R4.1, R4.11, R9.1).** `index.html` loads `host-browser.js` first and calls
  `Ed.boot({host, frame})` after all 13 files. Under Node, `require('./src/host-node.js')` gives `createHost` and
  `loadEdwin`; then `Ed.boot({host})`. Boot loads `emacs`, `evil`, `org`, `ai`, `init`, then the user's
  `~/.config/edwin/init.scm` when the host has one. Each shipped file is a feature, so `(require 'org)` does not load it again.
- **Frames (R9.2, headless part).** Page elements are parts of a frame made by `Ed.makeFrame(root, parts)` and read
  with `frame.el(name)`. `selected-frame` is `#f` with no page. Per-frame window trees and minibuffers come with E3.
- **Language (R4.3–R4.10, R4.31–R4.34).** BigInt exact integers, R7RS ports and buffer ports
  (`open-buffer-output-port`), first-class environments, source locations, weak tables, record printers,
  `provide`/`require` over `load-path`, handlers before unwinding, a condition hierarchy, restarts, and a shadow
  stack capped at 10,000 frames.
- **Markers (R6.11, R6.12).** One routine, `shiftMarkers`, moves point and the other windows' points (after
  markers), the mark, Evil's marks and jumps and the temps (before markers) through every change, and undo
  puts back markers a deletion moved. `copy-marker`, `set-marker`, `marker-insertion-type` and the rest work as in Emacs.
- **Hooks (R4.22, R4.23).** `before-change-functions` and `after-change-functions` run for every change, undo
  included; `(edit-origin)` says `local`, `remote`, `server`, `disk` or `agent` (`Ed.withOrigin` sets it). A
  function that signals is reported and removed. Pre-command, find-file, save, kill-buffer, buffer-list-update,
  window-configuration-change and focus hooks are Scheme hook variables.
- **Advice, modes, buffer-locals (R4.24–R4.26).** `advice-add` with all six kinds; `define-minor-mode`,
  `define-derived-mode`; `make-local-variable`, `setq-local`, `defvar-local`, `buffer-local-value`,
  `kill-local-variable`, `default-value`, `put` and `get`.

Choices E0 made where the spec left one open:
- A minor mode's state is in `NAME-enabled` (without `-mode`), not in `NAME`: Edwin Scheme is a Lisp-1, so the
  variable cannot share the command's name. `define-minor-mode` takes `:variable` to name another.
- Called from Lisp with no argument, a mode command turns the mode on; as a command it toggles (as in Emacs).
- Shadow-stack entries are pushed when a compound procedure is entered, not at each call site, to stay under 10%.
- No rationals: `(exact 2.5)` is 2.5. `guard` tests its clauses before unwinding. The watchdog and `quit` are not
  under `error`, so `error?` is false for them and `guard` with `error?` does not catch them.
- `(newline)` stays the editor command from `emacs.scm`, as in Emacs; write a line break to a port with `write-string`.
- Retiring the localStorage stores and the importer (R4.12) wait for served mode (E3); the core already reaches
  storage only through the host.

## Step E1: edwind, the text daemon (done)

`edwin/server/` is edwind: a Node process that loads the core headless, keeps every shared buffer as an Edwin
buffer, sequences edits from any number of clients over `edit.sock`, journals them, saves atomically and watches
the files on disk. `crates/wb-cli` is `wb buf`, `wb eval`, `wb edit` and `wb repl` over the same socket.
`nix/package.nix` installs `share/edwin/{src,scm,server}` and `bin/edwind`; `nix/module.nix` has
`services.workbench.edit.*` and `workbench-edit.service`; `nix/checks.nix` has `edwin-ot`, `edit-conformance`,
`edit-crash` (about thirteen minutes: 1,000 kills) and `edit-disk`; `nix/vm.nix` step 10 covers R16.18's E1 part.

Layout of `edwin/server/`: `main.mjs` (config, start, listen, `--check`, `--export`, evaluation, the E1 server
commands), `session.mjs` (one client: §7 messages), `sequencer.mjs` (rebase, apply, journal, ack, replay, undo),
`buffers.mjs` (open, save, revert, disk changes, compaction, index), `journal.mjs` (group commit, snapshots, the
image log), `files.mjs` (text files, CRLF, atomic save), `paths.mjs` (ids and the file authority of R14.8),
`watch.mjs` (inotify, the line-then-character diff, the three-way merge), `proto.mjs` (constants and field
checks). `edwin/src/ot.js` is the OT library both ends share; `edwin/test/edit-client.mjs` is the test client.

Running edwind by hand: `edwind --config edit.json` where `edit.json` has at least `notesDir` (see
`loadConfig` in `main.mjs` for the fields of R15.4); the socket's directory must be yours and 0700.

Choices E1 made where the spec left one open, and where it had to deviate:
- **No `--permission` (R14.12).** Node 22 and 24 disable `fsync` and `fdatasync` under the permission model, and the
  journal and atomic save need both (R8.3, R8.7). `bin/edwind` runs with `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings`,
  `--frozen-intrinsics`, `--max-old-space-size` and `--stack-size`; `main.mjs` replaces every function of
  `child_process` before anything else runs (`guardProcesses`, R4.45), and the Authority in `paths.mjs` is the
  one check on file writes, with the unit's `ProtectSystem=strict` and `ReadWritePaths` behind it. The
  conformance suite checks the flags in effect and the guard (R16.16).
- **Stack size.** The Scheme cap of 10,000 frames (R4.34) needs about 7 MiB of JS stack in direct mode (about
  8.4 MiB in E2's generator mode); Node's default reaches about 1,500. E1 sized `--stack-size` from `ulimit -s`;
  since E2 `main.mjs` runs the server on a worker thread whose stack it sizes itself (`runInThread`, 32 MiB,
  `EDWIND_STACK_MIB`), so neither `bin/edwind` nor the unit depends on the soft limit. `guard` catches the JS
  stack running out as the `recursion-depth` condition when the stack is smaller than the cap. Browser frames
  keep the browser's depth.
- **Resend acks wait for the disk.** A batch's `(cid, seq)` is recorded when it is applied, but a resend arriving
  before its `fdatasync` returns gets the ack only after it (R7.15 with R8.3). Edits for a batch go to the clients
  attached when it was applied; a client that opens in between gets it from the `open{since}` replay, never twice.
- **Journal `ENOSPC`.** An append that fails rolls the batch back (text, history, version) and refuses the edit
  with `read_only` naming the error; the buffer stays read-only until a save or a restart. A save needs no
  append and clears it. Nothing acked is lost (R16.7). `EDWIND_FAULT=enospc-save|enospc-journal` injects the
  failure for the crash suite; the container has no quota filesystem.
- **A whole last journal line without its newline counts;** a torn one is dropped and logged (R16.6).
- **The watchdog interrupt reports as the `timeout` condition** (R14.13), with the deadline 2 s for frames and
  web, 30 s for `wb`; `server-edit` calls have none.
- **`server-edit-done` and `server-edit-abort`** are E1 server commands that finish a `wb edit --wait` (exit 0,
  saving if modified; exit 1) until frames exist (E3); a kill of the buffer also ends it with 1.
- **`name:` ids** attach to Edwin's own buffers; the server's special ones (`*Messages*`, `*scratch*` and the
  like) open read-only with the reason `server special buffer`. Files outside the writable paths open
  read-only with the reason `outside the writable paths` (R14.9); files over 32 MiB open read-only and
  unjournaled; non-UTF-8 files are `not_text`.
- **Undo.** Undoing one's own batch after a later batch of someone else is done by `OT.undoOps`: the inverse,
  transformed through everything after it, with complete undo pairs cancelled (`undo.of`, `undo.ofCid`), so
  a redo after an undo returns the text. A partial undo says so in `msg` (R6.17). Server undo batches are
  `undo: {g: "undo-…", of, ofCid}`.
- **Markers under concurrency (R16.3).** Markers that no deletion reached agree between every replica and the
  server. A marker at the boundary of a deleted range can legitimately differ by the length of a concurrent
  insert landing at that point: both sides apply Edwin's `shiftMarkers` rule, but see the operations in a
  different order. `ot.test.mjs` states the property that holds; the frames' point stays where the user expects.
- **Edwin's key-value store** (`storage`) lives in `stateDir/storage.json`; compaction snapshots the text at the
  start of the retained history; journals compact at 4 MiB or 20,000 lines and after a save.
- **`web.json`** is untouched in E1 (`editSocket`, `refusePaths` and the notes forwarding came with E2, R15.5; the
  `/edit` relay is E3); the module writes `refusePaths` into `edit.json` only. `/api/status`'s `edit` block
  (R15.11) came with E2 as well.
- **VM steps left for later phases:** `wb edit --wait` finished from a frame (E3) and the A7 migration dry run
  (E4). The other R16.18 steps run in `nix/vm.nix` step 10. The security suite's socket cases of R16.12 are in
  `edit-conformance` (start refusal) and the VM (another uid).
- **`CRASH_ROUNDS`** sets the kill count of the crash suite (default 1,000); `OT_RUNS` the fast-check runs
  (default 10,000); `EDWIND_LOG=1` streams edwind's log in the test harness.

## Step E2: the Lisp machine (in review)

E2 makes the server image a Lisp machine (spec §4 after E0, §5 sessions, §11, §12, R15.6): the evaluator runs
in generator mode so threads can block, be preempted, time out and stop in a debugger; every `call{form}` and
every `(:where 'server)` command is a thread; the image log replicates definitions to frames; the notes index,
the model layer and processes through the hub are server modules with Scheme primitives. `nix/checks.nix` has
the gates `edit-image`, `edit-notes`, `edit-address`, `edwin-bench` (the evaluator budgets), `edit-lisp`,
`edwin-pool` and `edit-security`; wb-web forwards the notes endpoints and `sample` over `edit.sock`.

Layout added in E2 (`edwin/server/` unless said): `threads.mjs` (the scheduler, held buffers, ask, timers,
blocking primitives; `scm/threads.scm`), `debug.mjs` (the debugger, the inspector, apropos, find-definition,
room, list-threads, list-clients, the primitive registry; `scm/debug.scm`), `image.mjs` (the image log and its
replication, `*image-log*`), `notes.mjs` and `notes-parse.mjs` (the notes index on a worker thread;
`scm/notes-syntax.scm` is the grammar), `worker.mjs` and `jobs.mjs` (the worker pool's Node host, with
`src/pool.js`), `scm/address.scm` (block addresses, R6.14), `process.mjs` and `hub.mjs` (processes through the
hub; `scm/process.scm`), `wb.mjs` (§5 sessions and events; `scm/wb.scm`), `models.mjs` (backends,
`http-request`, credentials, `sample`, usage; `scm/models.scm`). Modules install through the extension points
of `main.mjs` (`MODULES`, `defineCommand`, `onMessage`, `statusProviders`, `buffers.on`).

The evaluator in generator mode (R4.38, `src/scheme.js`): the same compiler produces generator closures, run
with `yield*`, except for nodes that can call no compound procedure (constants, variable references, lambda,
calls to primitives with such arguments), which stay plain closures marked `.d`; a compound procedure keeps a
`gbody` for the generator path and a plain entry that drives it (`driveSync`), so JS callers (hooks, sort
predicates) still call procedures as functions. A thread yields `Block(promise)` (sleep, ask, join, I/O),
`PREEMPT` (its slice is over) or `Suspend(condition)` (the debugger); `ThreadState` and `switchTo` swap the
shadow stack, the handlers, the restarts and the parameter bindings. `loadEdwin(host, {mode: 'gen'})` selects
it; frames and workers stay in direct mode. Budget: the gen/direct geomean of `scheme-bench.mjs` is 1.2x
(limit 3x); the shadow stack costs 8.4% (limit 10%). Both suites of `scheme.test.mjs` run in both modes.

Choices E2 made where the spec left one open, and where it had to deviate:
- **Command threads are not preempted but do break.** A command thread (one `call{form}`, one server command)
  runs until it finishes, blocks or passes its deadline (R4.39), letting the event loop run every 20 ms so
  messages are read (interrupt, answer, edits to buffers it does not hold); nothing else runs in those breaks,
  since the thread is queued first again. Background threads get 5 ms slices round robin (R4.40). Deadlines
  count runnable time only: a blocked thread does not spend its 2 s (frames) or 30 s (cli).
- **Held buffers (R4.41).** A thread holds a shared buffer from the moment it edits it or makes it current
  (`set-buffer`, `with-current-buffer`, the call's `buf`) until its next blocking point or its end. Its edits
  (Edwin's edit log entries with origin `local`) are then sequenced as one batch in normal form, attributed to
  the caller (`by` with `via: "server"`, the frame's `cid`, R4.28); client edits to a held buffer wait in the
  sequencer and are rebased after it. A hold longer than 250 ms of runnable time ends the thread with the
  `timeout` condition; what it edited is still sequenced. A server batch (`replaceText`, undo, a second
  thread) on a held buffer first flushes the holder's pending edits, so history stays in rope order; the
  holder may then find its positions moved (recorded choice: holds do not block the server itself).
- **Handlers in direct nodes run in place and cannot block.** A primitive error raised from a `.d` node with
  handlers installed runs the handlers synchronously (R4.31 holds), but a handler that blocks there gets
  `cannot-block`; the generator path has no such limit.
- **The server runs on a worker thread** (`runInThread` in `main.mjs`) with `resourceLimits.stackSizeMb` 32, so
  the 10,000-frame cap holds whatever `ulimit -s` is; the main thread relays SIGTERM and SIGINT. Logs are
  written synchronously (`fs.writeSync(2, …)`) because a worker's `process.stderr` is an asynchronous relay.
  `--stack-size` left `bin/edwind` and the test flags; `EDWIND_NO_THREAD=1` runs on the main thread.
- **`timeout` and `thread-cancelled` never enter the debugger**; `quit` and `scheme-interrupt` are passive
  as before. `debug-on-error` defaults to true but applies to commands run for frames only: cli calls
  (R13.10) and background threads report. A thread suspended in the debugger is resumed by `interrupt`
  (`quit`) or `thread-kill` as any other; the debugger drops its session.
- **The abort restart ends a thread with the `aborted` condition** in the call's result (R4.37); `thread-join`
  sees `thread-cancelled`. A mutex a finished thread still holds is released.
- **Tail calls shape the backtrace.** `(define (f x) (car x))` shows only `car` at the signal: `f`'s frame is
  gone, as proper tail calls require. Locals by parameter name are those of live frames.
- **`define-command` accepts `(:where w)` after the interactive clause** (`set-command-where!`, both runtimes).
  `Server.command()` tries the JS server commands, then Scheme commands declared `server` or `both`; an
  interactive spec reads its arguments through `ask` when the call carries none. The image's six `image-*`
  commands are declared `server`. Frames send `call{cmd}` for them in E3 (R4.27); until then a frame that
  invokes one locally gets the E1 behaviour.
- **`ask` kinds** are `string`, `completing` (with `table`), `y-or-n`, `yes-or-no`, `number`, `char`; a cli
  caller gets `user-error` from `read-string` and friends (no minibuffer to ask).
- **Timers (R4.46)** accept seconds, `"N sec|min|hour"` and `"HH:MM"`; idle means no input from any client
  (`server.onInput`); each firing is a background thread named after the function.
- **`make-thread` from a thread run for a frame keeps that frame's `by`,** so a background thread's edits count
  as the frame's; timers' threads are the server's.
- **The primitive registry (R4.48)** is built at runtime: `def` captures each primitive's definer in the server
  image (frames skip it), and the registry reports name, arity, documentation, `where` (`server` for module
  primitives and marked ones, else `both`; no primitive is marked `frame` yet, a deviation to fill as frames
  grow), whether it blocks and its source line. `edwind --config … --primitives` prints it; `describe-function`
  says where a procedure runs. Named server commands and the Scheme commands of `debug.scm` are kept apart
  (`thread-list`/`list-threads`, `apropos-list`/`apropos`, `definition-of`/`find-definition`, `room-info`/`room`).
- **The debugger's keys are server commands** (`debug.scm`: `backtrace-mode`, `inspector-mode`); a frame that
  shows `*Backtrace*` runs them through `call{cmd}` with its point (E3 loads `debug.scm` in frames for the
  modes). `wb` reaches the same through `debugger-state`, `debugger-frames`, `debugger-eval`, `debugger-restart`,
  `debugger-continue`, `debugger-abort`, `inspect`.
- **R4.15 amendment (decided 2026-10-14 in the hypernotes thread, for E3 and later):** forms evaluated in a
  note's environment are not definitional for the image log (not appended, not broadcast). `image.record`
  inspects only the heads of top-level `call{form}` forms, so nothing in E2 conflicts; H1 implements it.
- **The notes index parser runs on a dedicated `worker_threads` worker** (not the pool): `notes-grep` and
  `unlinked-mentions` block the calling thread while it searches (the sync channel remains for callers outside
  a thread). The pool's Node host compiles the lexer from a source string inside the worker and duplicates the
  built-in jobs (deviations recorded in `jobs.mjs`).
- **Processes (R4.43–R4.45) and the §5 session API:** see `process.mjs`, `hub.mjs` and `wb.mjs` (their headers
  carry the choices); the primitives live in `edwin/server`, not `edwin/src/wb.js` as the spec names, because
  server-only code lives in `edwin/server`. The board family waits for EW-M4.
- **The model layer (§12, R14.4–R14.7):** see `models.mjs` (backends, `http-request`, `credential`, `sample`,
  the usage log). Keys arrive through `LoadCredential` only; handles print as `#<credential NAME>`.
